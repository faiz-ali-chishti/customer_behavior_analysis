# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data analytics workflow** focused on analyzing customer shopping behavior using retail transaction data. The goal is to extract actionable business insights related to customer demographics, purchasing patterns, discounts, subscriptions, and product performance.

The project uses **Python for analysis**, **MySQL for SQL queries**, **Power BI for visualization**, and includes a **written report and presentation created using Gamma**.

---

## Dataset
- Retail transactional dataset with **3,900 purchase records**
- Contains customer demographics, purchase details, discounts, shipping types, ratings, and subscription status
- Minor missing values handled during data cleaning

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) – Data loading, EDA, cleaning, feature engineering  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis and documentation  
- **MySQL Server** – SQL-based business analysis  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard  
- **Gamma** – Business presentation (PPT)  
- **GitHub** – Version control and project sharing

## Project Workflow
1. Loaded the dataset using Python (Pandas)
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Cleaned and standardized data
4. Engineered features such as age groups and purchase frequency
5. Exported cleaned data and ran SQL queries in MySQL
6. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard
7. Created a detailed project report
8. Designed a presentation using Gamma

## SQL Analysis
SQL queries were used to analyze:
- Revenue by gender and age group
- Subscribers vs non-subscribers spending behavior
- Top-performing and highest-rated products
- Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)
- Discount and shipping behavior

---

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides:
- Revenue and customer segmentation insights
- Subscription performance comparison
- Product and category-level trends
- Interactive filters for better exploration

---

## Results & Insights
- Identified high-value customer segments
- Subscribers showed higher average spending
- Certain products were highly discount-dependent
- Clear opportunities for loyalty programs and targeted marketing
